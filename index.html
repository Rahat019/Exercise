	<p>Bangladesh – one of the world’s most densely populated countries – faces many challenges despite reducing poverty and violence in recent years. Potential sources of conflict still exist in the country, including political violence, corruption, gender-based violence, organised crime, political polarisation, low trust in security and justice institutions, and the growth of extremism.</p>
